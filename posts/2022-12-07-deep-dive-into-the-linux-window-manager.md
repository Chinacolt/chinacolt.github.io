Resource Footprint Analysis:
Let's dive into the nitty-gritty of Linux window managers and unravel the mysteries of memory usage, CPU utilization, and rendering speed. Picture this: your Linux system is like a bustling kitchen, with different window managers taking on various roles like chefs preparing a feast. Now, just like in a kitchen, each chef (window manager) has its own style, speed, and efficiency in whipping up dishes (managing windows).
Memory usage is like the pantry space each chef occupies. Some window managers are like minimalistic chefs who only need a few ingredients at a time, while others are like hoarders, stocking up on everything in sight.
